# 2584

The ever-popular 2048, but using [Fibonacci numbers](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) instead of powers of two. In this version, instead of tiles with equal numbers being combinable, tiles with numbers that are consecutive in the Fibonacci sequence are combinable (and will create tiles with their sum).

A checker-free version of [2584](//joshlf13.github.io/2048-Fibonacci/), which is a small fork of [2048](//gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which is a clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](//oxguy3.github.io/2048-Fibonacci/)
